# dpr-js

Steps:

* [ ] Create repo dpr-js
* [ ] Scaffold your react app - create an index.html, vendor libs etc 
* [ ] Create fixture data package to work with
  * [ ] Data Package with resource data but we will ignore the resource data for now! Write out a vega-lite view with the data inlined as values ...
* [ ] Create a simple react view that renders this graph using just the vega-lite with inlined data
  * [ ] add vega-lite libs
  * [ ] write code to link together - should be super simple
* [ ] Add support for `dataSource` - i.e. no inline data and injecting data from the data package resource
  * [ ] New fixture - without inline data and dataSource ...

Next: introduce tests ... 

Next: plotly support

Next: recline spec conversion

Do a react view for handsontable ...
